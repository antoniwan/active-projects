Hey team!

We will re-use the same base code from KFC's Mom Day Off and Sprint's Amo Ser
Latino (meme-maker). You can find the repositories:
[here](https://bitbucket.org/media8/kfc-mom-day) and
[here](https://bitbucket.org/media8/sprint_amoserlatina).

# Features

Check out the wireframes that Ariel constructed for us
[here](http://m8.companyworkflow.com/#tasks/9657969?c=3241529).

The core functionalities are:

* mobile first
* upload or select your picture
* add a frame to the picture
* after picture completion, you can now:
  * share
    * facebook
    * twitter
  * download
  * others (can we use the phone's native share options - refer to 1.4.2 on the
    wireframes)
