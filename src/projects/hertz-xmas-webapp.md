Hey team!

We will re-use the same base code from KFC's Mom Day Off and Sprint's Amo Ser
Latino (meme-maker). You can find the repositories:
[here](https://bitbucket.org/media8/kfc-mom-day) and
[here](https://bitbucket.org/media8/sprint_amoserlatina).

* add a frame to the picture
* after picture completion, you can now:
